# Overview

This repository contains a Dockerfile and some scripts which demonstrate a way in which you might run [IBM Integration Bus](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibm-integration-bus) in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/whatisdocker/) container.

This repository also contains a Dockerfile and some scripts which demonstrate a way in which you might run [IBM Integration Bus](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibm-integration-bus) with an [IBM MQ] Server(http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibm-mq).

IBM would [welcome feedback](#issues-and-contributions) on what is offered here.

# Docker Hub
A pre-built version of the stand-alone IIB image is available on Docker Hub as [`ibmcom/iib`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/iib/) with the following tags:

  * `10.0.0.11`, `latest` ([Dockerfile](https://github.com/ot4i/iib-docker/blob/master/10.0.0.11/iib/Dockerfile))
  * `10.0.0.10` ([Dockerfile](https://github.com/ot4i/iib-docker/blob/master/10.0.0.10/Dockerfile))
  
A pre-built version of the IIB with MQ Server image is available on Docker Hub as [`ibmcom/iib-mq-server`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/iib-mq-server/) with the following tags:

  * `10.0.0.11`, `latest` ([Dockerfile](https://github.com/ot4i/iib-docker/blob/master/10.0.0.11/iib-mq-server/Dockerfile))

# Building the image

The image can be built using standard [Docker commands](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerimages/) against the supplied Dockerfile.  For example:

~~~
cd 10.0.0.11/iib
docker build -t iibv10image .
~~~

This will create an image called `iibv10image` occupying approximately 1.15GB of space (including the size of the underlying Ubuntu base image) in your local Docker registry:

~~~
REPOSITORY     TAG       IMAGE ID        CREATED          SIZE
iibv10image    latest    b8403ecfcd0d    2 seconds ago    1.15GB
ubuntu         14.04     132b7427a3b4    3 weeks ago      188MB
~~~

If you wish to build the image with an MQ install, then run something like the following:

~~~
cd 10.0.0.11/iib-mq-server
docker build -t iib-mq-image .
~~~

# What the image contains

The built image contains a full installation of [IBM Integration Bus for Developers Edition V10.0](https://ibm.biz/iibdevedn). If you install the stand-alone image, which does not contain an installation of IBM MQ, some functionality may not be available, or may be changed - see this [topic](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bb28660_.htm) for more information.

# Running a container

After building a Docker image from the supplied files, you can [run a container](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/usingdocker/) which will create and start an Integration Node to which you can [deploy](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/af03890_.htm) integration solutions.


## Running with the default configuration
In order to run a container from this image, it is necessary to accept the terms of the IBM Integration Bus for Developers license.  This is achieved by specifying the environment variable `LICENSE` equal to `accept` when running the image.  You can also view the license terms by setting this variable to `view`. Failure to set the variable will result in the termination of the container with a usage statement.  You can view the license in a different language by also setting the `LANG` environment variable.

In addition to accepting the license, you can optionally specify an Integration Node name using the `NODENAME` environment variable and an Integration Server name using the `SERVERNAME` environment variable. If using the image with MQ, you can also specify a Queue Manager name using the `MQ_QMGR_NAME` environment variable.

The last important point of configuration when running a container from this image, is port mapping.  The Dockerfile exposes ports `4414` and `7800` by default, for Integration Node administration and Integration Server HTTP traffic respectively.  This means you can run with the `-P` flag to auto map these ports to ports on your host.  Alternatively you can use `-p` to expose and map any ports of your choice. The same applies to the image with MQ where the additional port exposed by default is `1414` for the MQ listener.

For example:

~~~
docker run --name myNode -e LICENSE=accept -e NODENAME=MYNODE -e SERVERNAME=MYSERVER -P iibv10image
~~~

If you wish, you can also deploy an IBM Integration Bus BAR file by specifying a [Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/) which makes the BAR file(s) available when the container is started:
~~~
docker run --name myNode -v  /local/path/to/BARs:/tmp/BARs/<yourbars> -e LICENSE=accept -e NODENAME=MYNODE -e SERVERNAME=MYSERVER -P iibv10image 
~~~

This will run a container that creates and starts an Integration Node called `MYNODE` and exposes ports `4414` and `7800` on random ports on the host machine.  At this point you can use:
~~~
docker port <container name>
~~~

to see which ports have been mapped then connect to the Node's web user interface as normal (see [verification](# Verifying your container is running correctly) section below).

## Running with the default configuration and a volume
The above example will not persist any configuration data or messages across container runs.  In order to do this, you need to use a [volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/).  For example, you can create a volume with the following command:

```
docker volume create qm1data
```

You can then run a queue manager using this volume as follows:

```
docker run --name myNode -e LICENSE=accept -e NODENAME=MYNODE -e SERVERNAME=MYSERVER -e MQ_QMGR_NAME=QM1 -v qm1data:/mnt/mqm -P iibv10image
```

The Docker image always uses `/mnt/mqm` for MQ data, which is correctly linked for you under `/var/mqm` at runtime.  This is to handle problems with file permissions on some platforms.

## Customizing the queue manager configuration
You can customize the configuration in several ways:

1. By creating your own image and adding your own MQSC file into the `/etc/mqm` directory on the image.  This file will be run when your queue manager is created.
2. By using [remote MQ administration](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.adm.doc/q021090_.htm), via an MQ command server, the MQ HTTP APIs, or using a tool such as the MQ web console or MQ Explorer.

Note that a listener is always created on port 1414 inside the container.  This port can be mapped to any port on the Docker host.

## Running administration commands

You can run any of the Integration Bus
 commands using one of two methods:

#### Directly in the container

Attach a bash session to your container and execute your commands as you would normally:

~~~
docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash
~~~

At this point you will be in a shell inside the container and can source `mqsiprofile` and run your commands.

#### Using Docker exec

Use Docker exec to run a non-interactive Bash session that runs any of the Integration Bus commands.  For example:

~~~
docker exec <container name> /bin/bash -c mqsilist
~~~

## Running MQ commands
It is recommended that you configure MQ in your own custom image.  However, you may need to run MQ commands directly inside the process space of the container.  To run a command against a running queue manager, you can use `docker exec`, for example:

```
docker exec -it <container name> dspmq
```

Using this technique, you can have full control over all aspects of the MQ installation.  Note that if you use this technique to make changes to the filesystem, then those changes would be lost if you re-created your container unless you make those changes in volumes.

## Accessing logs

This image also configures syslog, so when you run a container, your node will be outputting messages to /var/log/syslog inside the container.  You can access this by attaching a bash session as described above or by using docker exec.  For example:

~~~
docker exec <container id> tail -f /var/log/syslog
~~~

# Verifying your container is running correctly

Whether you are using the image as provided or if you have customised it, here are a few basic steps that will give you confidence your image has been created properly:

1. Run a container, making sure to expose port 4414 to the host - the container should start without error
2. Run mqsilist to show the status of your node as described above - your node should be listed as running
3. Access syslog as descried above - there should be no errors
4. Connect a browser to your host on the port you exposed in step 1 - the Integration Bus web user interface should be displayed.

At this point, your container is running and you can [deploy](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/af03890_.htm) integration solutions to it using any of the supported methods.
